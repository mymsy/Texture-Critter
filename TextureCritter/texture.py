'''Texture synthesis helper classes

class Texture -- provides functions for working with a base PIL.Image
class EmptyTexture (subclasses Texture) -- a Texture variation that starts
    empty, with all pixels marked as uninitialised

class Shape -- generic base class to define the sampling shape for texture 
    region comparison
class SquareShape (subclasses Shape) -- defines a square Shape of given radius
class EllShape (subclasses Shape) -- defines an L-shaped Shape (rows above
    and columns to the left on the same row) of given radius
